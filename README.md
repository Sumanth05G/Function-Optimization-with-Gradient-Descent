# Visualising-Gradient-Descent
Visualising two gradient descent models one with constant step size and other with decreasing step size for function (x^2 + sin(8*x)). 1.png is for constant step size, where learning rate is taken small, 2.png is for decreasing step size, initial learning rate taken is more

Multi variable function optimum computation, considered example (x-3)^2 + (y-5)^2
